Finding minimum of banana function...
Downhill simplex finished after 51 iterations.
banana(1.000000, 1.000000) = 0.000000.
Finding minimum of Himmelblau function with starting a simplex that's a square centered on 0...
Downhill simplex finished after 67 iterations.
Himmelblau(3.024069, 2.098405) = 0.241889.
(there are several, but the function rises extremely fast away from them)
Seeing what happens with the mexican hat potential function...
Downhill simplex finished after 44 iterations.
sombrero(2.088089, -0.799926) = -25.000000.
x^2+y^2 = 5.000000, should be 5.
Behold! Broken symmetry!

Solving (1-x)=0, 10(y-xÂ²)=0...
x = 1.000000, y = 1.000000 solves the system (after 3 iterations).
Calculating the square root of 101 by solving
x^2 - 101 = 0
sqrt(101) = 10.049876 (in fact 10.049876) after 7 iterations.

I wonder how GPS works...
Consider 3 spheres given by centrum and radius:
(5,0,0), radius 5,
(0,0,0), radius 3,
(1,-2,-4), radius 5.
Finding intersection by solving the system
(x-5)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 5^2 = 0,
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 3^2 = 0,
(x-1)^2 + (y+2)^2 + (z+4)^2 - 5^2 = 0...
Intersection at (0.900000, 2.379606, -1.589803) found after 10 iterations.
